      content="As Hunter College's first Mexican Student Union, we have the important task of representing a large group of students at this institution. We strive to create not just a community but a family in which we all celebrate the diversity and traditions within our motherland. Through social events, our members can network and simultaneously enjoy aspects of Mexican culture, such as food and music. Mexican Student Union at Hunter College services Hunter College students by enriching their college experience by providing members with the opportunity to network and learn about their roots/heritage, all at their place of study."
